Practice problems

You may use a web-based version of Python such as PyFiddle, Repl.It, or PythonFiddle to complete the exercises. Just make sure you are using version 3 or greater. If you use a web-based Python environment, you can easily share code with course instructors if you need help. You may also use a local installation of Python.

You should copy the entire code snippet into your Python editor. Your code should be placed in the area that says "student code goes here" highlighted in yellow. This is inside the function. When you run this entire code snippet, there are test cases below your code. Your output should match the expected output.
Task 1

Complete the function that takes an integer as input and returns the factorial of that integer

from math import factorial

def calculate(x):
# Student code goes here
 
print(calculate(3)) #expected outcome: 6
print(calculate(9)) #expected outcome: 362880

Task 2

Complete the function that takes a list as input and returns a randomized item from that list

import random as r

def selection(x):
# Student code goes here
 
print(selection(['apple','banana','orange','grape']))
print(selection([7,5,3,9,12,4,8,10]))

Task 3

Complete the function that takes as input an integer for a number of days and prints the total number of seconds in that number of days

import datetime

def currentDate(x):
# Student code goes here
 
currentDate(4) #expected outcome: The total number of seconds is 345600.0.
currentDate(7) #expected outcome: The total number of seconds is 604800.0.

Task 4

Complete the function to return the current date

import datetime as dt

def currentDate():
# Student code goes here
 
print(currentDate()) #Expected outcome will vary, but should follow this format: The current date is 9-11-2018.

Task 5

Complete the function that takes an integer as input, multiplies by e, and returns result rounded up

from math import e,ceil

def mathCalculation(x):
# Student code goes here
 
#expected outcome: 9
print(mathCalculation(3))    

#expected outcome: 25
print(mathCalculation(9))

Task 6

Complete the function to return the number of leap years in the list

import calendar

# Complete the function to return the number of leap years in the list
def countLeapYears(yearList):
# Student code goes here
 
# expected output: 2
print(countLeapYears([2001, 2018, 2020, 2090, 2233, 2176, 2200, 2982]))
 
# expected output: 4
print(countLeapYears([2001, 2018, 2020, 2092, 2204, 2176, 2200, 2982]))

Task 7

Complete the function to print the full name of the month using the calendar library

import calendar

# Complete the function to print the full name of the month using the calendar library 
def printMonthName(monthNum):
# Student code goes here
 
# expected output: March
printMonthName(3)
 
# expected output: November
printMonthName(11)

Task 8

Complete the function to print the full name of the day of the week

import calendar, datetime

# Complete the function to print the full name of the day of the week
def printWeekdayName(year, month, day):
# Student code goes here
 
# expected output: Friday    
printWeekdayName(2001, 8, 31)
 
# expected output: Monday
printWeekdayName(2018, 10, 1)

Task 9

Complete the following function to return a random number between 5 and 8 exclusive

import random

# Complete the following function to return a random number
# between 5 and 8 exclusive
def getRandom():
# Student code goes here
 
# expected output: You should only get 5s, 6s, and 7s
for i in range(10):
    print(getRandom())

Task 10

Complete the function to add 90 days to the given date and return the new date

import datetime

# Complete the function to add 90 days to the given date and return the new date
def add90Days(someDate):
# Student code goes here
 
# expected output: 2018-12-30
print(add90Days(datetime.date(2018, 10, 1)))
 
# expected output: 2015-05-12
print(add90Days(datetime.date(2015, 2, 11)))
